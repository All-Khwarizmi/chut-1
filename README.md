**Chut is a noise meter app designed for managing group work. When the noise pass the threshold a sound is emitted in order to make students be quite.**


### Overview

Chut helps teachers maintain an optimal working environment by monitoring noise levels in the classroom. When voices get too loud, the app emits an audible alert to prompt students to lower their volume. Using the built-in decibel meter on your phone or tablet, Chut detects when noise passes a threshold you set. At the tap of a button, it can then emit a sound—like a bell, buzzer or verbal reminder—to instantly quiet a chatty class and get students back on task. With Chut, you'll never have to raise your voice to be heard again.
